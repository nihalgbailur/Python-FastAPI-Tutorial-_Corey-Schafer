## Table 1

| Feature or Component | Description | Tools and Technologies | Implementation Details | Documentation/Endpoint Strategy | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CRUD Operations | Standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for managing blog posts within the application. | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy | Users can create new posts, update content, or delete existing posts; includes authorization checks to ensure only owners can edit or delete content. | Programmatic JSON API endpoints (e.g., /api/posts) included in documentation; HTML routes excluded. | 1 |
| User Authentication and Registration | Secure system for new user signup and existing user login using industry-standard security practices. | FastAPI, JWT tokens, secure password hashing | Implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management and password hashing for database security. | Used by the front-end to interface with the backend API for session creation. | 1 |
| HTML vs. JSON Routing | Distinction between routes meant for programmatic access and those meant for human readers. | FastAPI, HTMLResponse | JSON routes return dictionaries/lists (auto-converted); HTML routes use the HTMLResponse class with string or template returns. | JSON API routes use include_in_schema=True (default); HTML routes use include_in_schema=False to keep documentation clean. | 1 |
| Automatic API Documentation | Interactive and modern documentation generated automatically from the Python code. | Swagger UI, ReDoc | Generated by FastAPI without manual configuration; provides 'Try it out' functionality and Curl command snippets. | Available at /docs (Swagger) and /redoc (ReDoc) routes. | 1 |
| Project Initialization and Package Management | Setup of the project structure and dependency management using modern Python tools. | UV, FastAPI Standard Extras | Used uv init to create project and uv add fastapi[standard] to install the framework, Uvicorn, and CLI. | Not in source | 1 |
| Database Management | Persistence layer for storing user data and blog posts, transitioning from local to production-grade systems. | SQLAlchemy, SQLite, PostgreSQL | Initial development uses SQLite for simplicity, with a planned transition to PostgreSQL for production. | Not in source | 1 |
| Data Validation | Ensures that incoming request data matches the required format and types. | Pydantic models | Pydantic models are created to define the structure and validation rules for API data. | Integrated into the automatic API schema/documentation. | 1 |
| Background Tasks | Execution of non-blocking processes in the background, such as communication services. | FastAPI BackgroundTasks | Used for functionalities like sending password reset emails without stalling the user response. | Not in source | 1 |
| Frontend Features | User interface components including visual themes and media handling. | Jinja2 (planned), CSS (Light/Dark mode) | Includes a light/dark mode switch and profile picture upload functionality; uses dynamic pagination to fetch more posts. | Not in source | 1 |
